subscription habits.

The goal is to uncover actionable insights that can inform strategic 
decision-making for the business. By delving into subscription status, 
purchase trends, and other relevant factors, this analysis aims to provide a 
thorough understanding of the customer base.

interactions but also paves the way for targeted strategies to enhance 
customer satisfaction, increase subscription rates, and optimize marketing 
efforts
